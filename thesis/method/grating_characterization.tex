\subsection{Characterization of sub-wavelength grating}

Figures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pictures of the membrane before patterning.
    \item AFM profile of the grating after patterning. (talk about profilometry and the physical parameters of the grating and their meaning for project).
    \item MAYBE: MIST simulation showing that the model accurately predicts the simulated spectra.
\end{itemize}
