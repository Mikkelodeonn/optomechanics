\subsection{The single Fano cavity}

\subsection{The double Fano cavity}

Figures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulated spectra of M3 and M5.
    \item Simulated length scans of M3 and M5.
    \item M3/M5 cavity trans. spectra (on resonance + full range)
    \subitem for lengths: $l_{M3} \rightarrow l_{M5}$
    \subitem for length: $l = 1/2 \cdot (l_{M3} + l_{M5})$
    \item Optimal result comparison with single fano/broadband cavities of similar losses.
    \item Optimal result comparison with the ideal case from prev. section.
    \item Simulated linewidth as a function of cavity length (include the same for broadband and single fano cavities).
\end{itemize}
