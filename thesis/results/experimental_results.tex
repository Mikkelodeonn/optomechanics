\section{Experimental results}

\subsection{The single Fano cavity}

Figures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single fano cavity transmission as a function of wavelength.
    \item Short scan of the single fano cavity tranmission, with found linewidth.
    \item Long scan Fabry-Perot fringes for determining FSR -> cavity length. 
    \item linewidth as a function of cavity length (compare with broadban cavity).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The double Fano cavity}

\subsubsection{Realizing the double fano model}

Figures: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fit of the double fano model (long + short cavity)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Double fano off-resonance Fabry-Perot cavity}

Figures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Off-resonance double fano transmission as a function of wavelength (show that the off resonance transmission goes close to 100 percent for a well-aligned cavity).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The double fano linewidth}

Figures: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Semi-short" scan data, fit to the double fano transmission model. 
    \item Short scan data, fit to the Fano function (for measuring linewidth).
    \item Linewidth as a function of cavity length (compare double fano, single fano and broadband cavitites).
\end{itemize}
